"""Tests for the runner's startup-validation and capability-probing logic.

Both behaviors exist to keep the hub from routing work to a runner that
*looks* healthy but cannot actually execute tasks:

* ``RunnerConfig.from_env`` must auto-create an explicitly-configured
  ``workspace_root`` if it is missing, so a service install + reboot
  cycle does not get stuck on a directory the operator forgot to create.
  When the env var is unset, fall back to ``os.getcwd()`` (which is
  always an existing directory).
* ``detect_tools`` must probe each candidate binary with its ``--version``
  argv before reporting it. The Windows ``py.exe`` launcher is on PATH for
  every account, but under accounts that have no installed Python (e.g.
  LocalSystem) it exits 103/112 with "No installed Python found!" -- the
  runner advertised ``py`` and the hub routed every Python task to a host
  that could not run them.
