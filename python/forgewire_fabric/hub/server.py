"""ForgeWire hub HTTP/SSE service.

Runs on the always-on hub host. Exposes a small REST + SSE API used by:

* the dispatcher MCP server (driver host, drives the queue from the main
  agent), reaching the hub over the LAN, and
* the runner MCP server (colocated on the hub), reaching the hub on
  localhost.

Auth: bearer token from ``FORGEWIRE_HUB_TOKEN`` env (or ``--token-file`` path).
Legacy alias ``BLACKBOARD_TOKEN`` is also honoured.
Storage: SQLite WAL at ``FORGEWIRE_HUB_DB_PATH`` (default
``~/.forgewire/hub.sqlite3``). On first start, an existing
``~/.phrenforge/remote_subagent.sqlite3`` is auto-copied for one-shot upgrade.

Run::

    python -m forgewire_fabric.hub.server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8765

Hardening notes:
* Default bind is 127.0.0.1 (safe for colocation-only setups). The hub
  launcher (``scripts/remote/start_hub.ps1``) overrides this with 0.0.0.0
  so dispatchers on the LAN can reach it.
* Bearer required on every endpoint except ``/healthz``.
* SQLite is opened per-request via a context manager; WAL handles concurrency.
