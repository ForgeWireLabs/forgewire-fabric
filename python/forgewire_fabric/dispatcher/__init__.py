"""Dispatcher-side identity and signing helpers.

A "dispatcher" is anything that hands a sealed brief to the ForgeWire hub:
a CLI user, an MCP client, the VS Code extension host, an automation
script. Dispatchers own an ed25519 keypair (see
:mod:`forgewire_fabric.dispatcher.identity`) and may register that key with the
hub to send signed dispatches via ``POST /tasks/v2``.
